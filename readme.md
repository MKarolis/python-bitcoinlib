About
-----

Repository contains very simple programs that interact with a blockchain node (they need to be run on a functional bitcoin node).

- `rpc_block.py` example, computes total output value of a block
- `rpc_transaction.py` example, prints outputs of a given transaction
- `rpc-example.py` example, print out all outputs of a given transaction
- `ex1.py` calculates the cost of a given transaction
- `ex2.py` recalculates a block's hash and verifies it's corectness

[python-bitcoinlib](https://pypi.org/project/python-bitcoinlib/) was used for the implementation.

**Run with Python 2.7!:**   

From  the shell: `python <fileName>`
